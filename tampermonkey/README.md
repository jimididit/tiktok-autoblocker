## üîß Technical Details

### Blocking Process

The script uses a sophisticated 3-step blocking sequence:

1. **Click "More" button** (`[data-e2e="user-more"]`)
2. **Click "Block" option** (`div[role="button"][aria-label="Block"]`)
3. **Confirm blocking** (`button[data-e2e="block-popup-block-btn"]`)

### Private Account Detection

Advanced detection for private accounts:
- DOM element indicators (`[data-e2e="private-account"]`)
- Text content analysis ("This account is private")
- User subtitle detection ("Privateü¶à")
- Multiple fallback strategies

### Error Handling

- **Inaccessible accounts**: Automatically skipped with logging

### URL Pattern Support

The script handles various TikTok URL formats:
- `/@username` (with @ symbol)
- `/username` (without @ symbol)
